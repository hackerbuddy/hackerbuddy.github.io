## Software Engineering Project: Planning a Trip to Los Angeles, California

**Project Introduction and SCRUM**

This is the Team 4 Github Trip project file for Software Engineering Class at Mizzou. 

We used [SCRUM](https://www.scrumalliance.org/why-scrum) to plan this trip. After creating an Axosoft account and assigning roles to each group member, we broke our work down into 3 sprints over 3 weeks. You can see our SCRUM board [here.](https://cjt6fd.axosoft.com/)

**Team Roles**

| Team Member  | Role          |
| ------------ |:-------------:|
| Calvin       | Scrum Master  |

## Logistics

We decided to plan the Flight, Transportation and Lodging first as constants, and then we planned the rest of the trip around these items. 
***
### Flight
***
| Date          | Depart        | Arrive       |  
| ------------- | ------------- |:------------:|
| 12/17/17      | COU 05:50 AM  | LAX 09:42 AM |
| 12/21/17      | LAX 12:00 PM  | COU 08:37 PM |


A family member will take us to the Columbia Airport.

Our flight to Los Angeles with United Airlines leaves at 5:50am on Sunday December 17th, but we will arrive an hour early to make it through security. We will arrive at 9:42 am in LAX and rent a vehicle to leave the airport and drive to our Air BnB in Pasadena.


Our flight back to Columbia leaves at 12:00pm on Thursday December 21 with United Airlines and we will arrive back home in Columbia at 8:37pm where a family member will take us home. 


Flight Cost: $2,412

***
### Transportation
***

All members are above the age of 21, **so all team members will be able to drive a rental vehicle**. So for ultimate conveinence, our team will rent 1-2 vehicles. All of our team members could squeeze into a modest Jeep Grand Cherokee, but where's the fun in that?

**Total Transportation budget= $570-$1520**

  <summary> Fuel Details </summary>

[Gas prices are $2.97 in Pasadena](https://www.gasbuddy.com/GasPrices/California/Pasadena). Estimating 7 hours of driving time every day with a [Jeep Cherokee at 21 miles/gallon in the city](https://www.google.com/search?q=mpg+for+jeep+cherokee&rlz=1C1CHBD_enUS728US729&oq=mpg+for+jeep+chero&aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0l4.4240j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

35mph avg speed in California * 7 hours driving time = 245 miles. 

245 miles/21 mpg = 11.6 gallons gas per day.

11.6 gallons * $3.00 = $35

$35 * 4 days + $17.50 * 1 day (last day will have little driving) = $157.50 or approx $160

Fuel Estimate 1 Vehicle= $160

Fuel Estimate 2 Vehicles=$320

### Lodging
***

<img src="https://github.com/djpkvf/Team-4-Software-Engineering-Trip/blob/features/lodgingPlan/rentalHouse.jpg" width="360" height="270">

To save money and have a cozy experience, we will be staying at an affordable "mid-century" AirBnB house in Pasadena for 4 nights at $104/night. It it conveniently located near Disneyland, Laguna Beach and our other favorite Los Angeles destinations. With 4 beds, only one team member will have to sleep on the sofa!

It is suggested that team members program a psuedo-random number generator to fairly decide who gets to sleep on the sofa.

Lodging Budget: $481


## Trip Days 1-5

### Day 1- Los Angeles

Our adventure in Los Angeles will begin at 9:42am.  In order to take in the most from LA we will want to see everything that it has to offer by going to Griffith's Observatory.  First, we will need to gather our luggage and then pick up our rental car.  We'll then get brunch at the Daily Grill, and then head to our rental house.  From there, we will then head to the observatory.  Parking is free, and the shuttle only cost $0.50 per person, so it's a cheap place to visit!

After checking out the observatory, and the Hollywood sign, we will head down to Beverly Hills, and go to Rodeo Dr.  This is a famous location for shopping and drops you right into the wealth of celebrities.  We will also get a late lunch here at Via Alloro.  After we are done in Beverly Hills we'll head back home.  There we will refresh ourselves, and head out for drinks at Ruth's Chris Steak House. It's an upscale restaurant in Pasadena, and features a full bar for us to unwind at.

Day 1 Budget: $17.50 for fees, $20 tipping, $575 food = $562.50 for the day
### Day 2 - Disneyland

<img src="https://github.com/djpkvf/Team-4-Software-Engineering-Trip/blob/features/Trip%20Days/Day%202/disneyland-00-full.jpg" alt="Disneyland" style="width:120px;height:90;">

On Day 2, we are going for a full day trip to Disneyland! It will take us about an hour to get there, so we'll rise early and leave before 7 to get to the park when it opens! We will start our day there with breakfast at Carnation Cafe. We will be free to wander around Disneyland and its seven themed areas, making use of our MAXpass that allows us to make Fastpass tickets on our mobile devices, until we get hungry again and head to our lunch destination Bengal Barbecue.

We have two activities planned for the evening. First, a reservation for Fantasmic! Dining Packages for dinner at Blue Bayou at 6:00. There we get to eat dinner and view the Fantasmic! show.

*Blue Bayou*

Finally, we will definitely make sure to catch the fireworks show at 9:30.

Day 2 Budget: $95 * 5 for meals/drinks + $141 * 5 for tickets/entrance + $100 * 5 for souvenirs/extras = $1680 total
### Day 3- Laguna Beach

**Day 3 Summary** 

On Day 3, we will get up early after cooking eggs and bacon and go to Laguna beach for a 2 hour surf lesson! Who cares that it's winter! We're gonna learn to surf! After renting wetsuits and boards and surfing for the day, we will eat at snazzy places such as the Driftwood Kitchen and the famous Parkway Grill.

In the evening we will hit up the classy Speakeasy like VIP's, and then party as hard as a bunch of CS/IT nerds can manage at the swanky Club 54.

*Club 54*

Day 3 Budget: $900 for meals/drinks + $670 for activities = $1570

### Day 4- Starwars and Hamilton
Ahhh Day 4, the day that I've been waiting for. Disneyland is cool, sure, but it doesn't match the cinematic value of Day 4. We start bright and early, Dominic is hard to wake up considering has absurd night before, but we get him up nonetheless; there's too much to do and not enough(just enough) time. We get up at 6:50, leave by 7:15, ( with enough time to fill up on gas) and then drive to Inglewood to go to The Rust Pot Cafe. Now the name may imply trash, but the food is anything but. Calvin gets the bully omelet($14.00), Dominic, still sick, gets the famous Belgian waffle($7.50), Braden get's the scrambled jamble($11.00), I get the big breakfast burger($12.00), and Lydia gets the overloaded breakfast sandwich($12.00); altogether we are set back $56.50.

Activity 1 is no big deal...we're just going to go to the new STAR WARS!! Now, it has been hard for me to refrain not sneaking out at night and going, but I refrained so to save face with my cohorts. It has been difficult nonetheless. Considering price of tickets, and a large popcorn and a few drinks we spend $125.00. 

<img src="https://github.com/djpkvf/Team-4-Software-Engineering-Trip/blob/features/Trip%20Days/Day%204/Murphy's%20Day/lastJedi.jpg" alt="Hamilton" style="width:100px;height:90;">


After the movie, we go to Leo's Taco Stand, a recommendation from my friend in the area, this meal is going to be super affordable considering that there are items on the menu that run for $1.00. It is like Dollar General for your mouth, and I love it. Just to be safe...let's say we all spend $8.00 because I decide to go ham(I actually eat carnitas). $40.00. (It is Cash Only, so we have to remember to get some money once we stop)

Now this one will hurt the wallet the most, but it will defintely strike the strongest chord(all puns intended). We are going to go to HAMILTON!!!!!!!! This trip is only 16 minutes away, but considering the timing, let's leave 2 hours and 16 minutes prior to the performance.  Tickets weren't cheap....$417 per, but considering our proximity to greatness, it'll be worth it.

<img src="https://github.com/djpkvf/Team-4-Software-Engineering-Trip/blob/features/Trip%20Days/Day%204/Murphy's%20Day/la-hamilton.jpg" alt="Hamilton" style="width:100px;height:90;">

After we cry from exposure to pure awesomeness, we are going to stop by this little ice cream shop that I heard about called -8 Degrees Celsius Ice Cream. Amongst the bunch of us, let's shoot for $40.00 of expenditures.

Day 4 Budget: 56.50 + 125.00 + 40.00 + 2085.00 + 40.00 = $2221.52
Cost of Getting to Hang out with Friends and Watch Hamilton : Priceless

AND SCENE!

### Day 5 - Universal Studios Hollywood

For our Grand Finale we will be hitting up Universal Studios Hollywood.  It's a 15.7 mile trip from our Pasedena AirBnb crib.  Thus we will wake up around 6:45am (Hopefully we can get Dominic to wake up by then), cook whatever leftover breakfast scraps we have, and hit the road by 7:15am.  Want to beat that early morning Highway 110 traffic.  

<img src="https://github.com/djpkvf/Team-4-Software-Engineering-Trip/blob/features/Trip%20Days/Day%205/Spotlight_Globe_802x535.jpg" alt="UniStudios" style="width:120px;height:90px;">

## Final Notes

In the end, we stayed within our time constraints and we spent $11,726.52 our of our $12,500 budget. More importantly, we all learned how to use SCRUM on Axosoft to keep track of our progress, Git for version control and Markdown to look good. :+1:
